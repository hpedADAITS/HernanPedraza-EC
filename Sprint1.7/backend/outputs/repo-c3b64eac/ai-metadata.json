    "LoginController": "The LoginController class handles user authentication and registration, provides username retrieval, and allows creating tasks after login.",
    "LoginController.LoginController": "The provided code snippet `LoginController.LoginController` appears to be an incomplete or malformed specification. It references a class named `LoginController` with a constructor `LoginController.LoginController`, which is not standard Java syntax — constructors do not have explicit return types (including `public`) and are not typically described as \"returning public\" since they do not return values.",
    "LoginController.login": "The `LoginController.login` method is a public endpoint in a web application that handles user authentication requests. It receives login credentials (typically username and password) via an HTTP request, validates them against stored user data (e.g., using a service layer or database), and returns a boolean value indicating whether the login was successful.",
    "LoginController.register": "The method `LoginController.register` is a member function within the `LoginController` class that handles user registration functionality. Its primary purpose is to process registration requests—typically receiving user input (such as username, password, email)—validating it against business or security rules, and storing the data in a persistent storage system (e.g., database). The method returns a boolean value: `true` indicates successful registration, and `false` signifies failure due to validation errors, duplicate entries, or other issues. This method is typically part of a RESTful API or web application flow where users create new accounts. Important technical details include input validation, potential use of cryptographic password hashing (e.g., bcrypt), uniqueness checks (e.g., unique email/username), and integration with authentication services or data persistence layers.",
    "TasksController": "The TasksController manages task data by loading it from a database and providing access to tasks based on filters, while ensuring singleton pattern through private constructor and instance retrieval.",
    "TasksController.TasksController": "The provided code snippet refers to a class named `TasksController` within a Java application, likely part of a web-based RESTful API (e.g., using Spring Boot). However, the specific implementation or method body is not included in the input.",

    "Task": "A Task class represents a task with properties such as ID, user ID, name, type, and due date.",
    "Task.getId": "The method `getById` in the `Task` class is not valid based on standard Java naming conventions and typical usage. A method named `getById` would typically be used to retrieve a task by an ID (e.g., `int getId()`), but the provided context states that \"Method returns int\", which suggests it might be intended as `getId()`, not `getById`.",
    "Task.getUserId": "The method `getUserId` in the `Task` class is a public accessor method that retrieves an integer representing the user ID associated with a task. Its primary purpose is to provide read-only access to the user identifier that links the task to a specific user entity. This method typically operates by returning a stored instance variable (e.g., `private int userId`) and does not modify any state. It assumes that the task object has been initialized with a valid user ID, and its behavior depends on proper instantiation or assignment of this field. No parameters are required, as it directly accesses the internal state of the Task object. This method supports data consistency and enables downstream systems (e.g., logging, permissions checks) to identify which user created or is associated with a given task.",
    "Task.getName": "The method `getName()` in the `Task` class is a public accessor method that retrieves the name of the task as a `String`. Its primary purpose is to provide read-only access to the task's name attribute, allowing external code to obtain the task identifier or label for display, logging, or processing purposes. This method typically follows standard Java naming conventions and assumes that the task instance has a private `name` field (e.g., of type `String`) which is accessed via getter logic. No side effects are performed; it simply returns the current value of the name property. The method is fundamental for object representation and interoperability in systems where task identification is required.",
    "User": "A User class represents a user with a username and password, allowing setting and retrieving of these credentials.",
    "User.User": "The provided snippet \"User.User\" appears to be an incomplete or malformed reference. In Java, a class named `User` would typically be defined with a class declaration such as:",
    "User.getUsername": "The method `getUsername()` is a public accessor method in the `User` class that retrieves and returns the username of an instance of the `User` class as a `String`. Its primary purpose is to provide controlled access to the user's username attribute, enabling other parts of the system to read the value without directly accessing the internal state. This method follows standard Java encapsulation principles, promoting data integrity by preventing direct modification of the username from external code. It assumes that the username is stored as a private field within the `User` class and is accessed via getter pattern (also known as \"getter\" or \"accessor\" method). No parameters are required, and it does not modify the object's state—making it a pure read operation.",
    "User.getPassword": "The method `User.getPassword()` is an instance method of the `User` class that retrieves and returns the password associated with a user object as a `String`. ",
    "DatabaseService": "A DatabaseService class provides methods to retrieve credentials, establish a database connection, check if a database exists, and execute queries returning result counts.",
    "DatabaseService.getUsername": "The `getUsername` method in the `DatabaseService` class is designed to retrieve a user's username from a persistent database. It typically executes a database query (e.g., using JDBC or an ORM like JPA/Hibernate) to fetch the username based on a provided identifier such as user ID, email, or authentication token. The method assumes the existence of a data source and schema that maps users to their credentials.",
    "DatabaseService.getPassword": "The method `DatabaseService.getPassword()` is a static method within the `DatabaseService` class that is intended to retrieve a password, typically used for database authentication. Its primary purpose is to provide access to a sensitive credential (such as a database password) stored securely within the service's configuration or data source.",
    "DatabaseService.connect": "The `DatabaseService.connect()` method is a static utility method within the `DatabaseService` class that establishes a database connection.
